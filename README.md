## Running the Project

Please cd into the folder project_code and simply run `python build.py` and then run `./prog`. It will render a rabbit by default and you can use arrow keys to control the camera to see the distance fog effect. If you want to run other objects in the common folder you can use `./prog ../common/objects/your_chosen_model.obj`.
